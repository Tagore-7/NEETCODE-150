#Given the root of a binary tree, return true if it is a valid binary search tree, otherwise return false.
#
#A valid binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:
#
#The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
#The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
#Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
#Example 1:
#
#
#
#Input: root = [2,1,3]
#
#Output: true
#Example 2:
#
#
#
#Input: root = [1,2,3]
#
#Output: false
#Explanation: The root node's value is 1 but its left child's value is 2 which is greater than 1.
#
#Constraints:
#
#1 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.
#-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

        def valid(node, left, right):
            if not node:
                return True

            if not (left < node.val < right):
                return False

            return valid(node.left, left, node.val) and valid(node.right, node.val, right)

        return valid(root, float("-inf"), float("inf"))
